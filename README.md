# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction Web App

This project is a beginner-friendly **Machine Learning web application** that predicts whether a user is eligible for a loan or not based on several input features. It integrates four different models — **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, and **Logistic Regression** — and presents their predictions along with a final combined output.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask (for web backend)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)
- HTML & CSS (frontend UI)
- Bootstrap-styled layout with emoji-enhanced UX 🎨
